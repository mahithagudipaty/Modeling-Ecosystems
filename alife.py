Description:
Simulates an artificial life ecosystem with rabbits and foxes.
Rabbits eat grass to survive and reproduce.
Foxes eat rabbits to survive and reproduce.
Both species face starvation if they go too many generations without food.

Model Assumptions:
- Field size: 65 x 65
- Grass regrowth rate: 3.5% chance per cell per generation

Rabbits:
- Initial population: 50
- Maximum offspring per generation: 1
- Starvation level: 3 generations without food
- Reproduction threshold: 2 units of food

Foxes:
- Initial population: 35
- Maximum offspring per generation: 3
- Starvation level: 12 generations without food
- Reproduction threshold: 1 unit of food

Output:
An animated matplotlib simulation and population dynamics over time.
